1. Given:

Path path1 = Paths.get("/projects/work/../fun");
Path path2 = Paths.get("games");
System.out.println(path1.resolve(path2));

Which of the following is the result of executing the above lines?
A. /project/work/fun/games
B. /project/fun/games
C. /project/work/../fun/games
D. games

The correct answer is C.
Path.resolve() doesn't remove redundancy in paths (that's done with Path.normalize() or Path.toRealPath()), it just combines two paths.
