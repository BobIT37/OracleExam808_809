1. The correct answer is A.
You can modify a list typed as List<?>, but when you call m2(), inside that method, the list has a different type, List<T>, which allows you to change the value of the second element.



2. The correct answer is A.
<T extends Number> means that you can assign a Number or one of its subclasses to the generic type. This applies to both, the type argument of the class Question_6_2 and to the variable t.



3. The correct answer is C.
Option C doesn't compile because you can only assign a list of type Object to l3, the lower-bounded wildcard doesn't allow you to assign a subclass (like String).



4. The correct answer is C.
<? super Number> allows you to assign a List of type Number or its superclass, which is done in line // 1.

The list can contain instances of Number or one of its subclasses. Since line // 3 tries to add an instance of the superclass of Number (Object), this line generates a compile-time error.
