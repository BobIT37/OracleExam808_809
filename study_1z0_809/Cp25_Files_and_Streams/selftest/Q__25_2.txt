B. Files.find() follows symbolic links by default.
C. Files.walk() follows symbolic links by default.

Answer D
Option A is false. Files.find() doesn't have a default subdirectory depth. This is passed as an argument to the method.
Option B is false. Files.find() follows symbolic links only if FileVisitOption.FOLLOW_LINKS is passed as an argument.
Option C is false. Files.walk() follows symbolic links only if FileVisitOption.FOLLOW_LINKS is passed as an argument.
Option D is true. Files.walk() traverses subdirectories recursively.
