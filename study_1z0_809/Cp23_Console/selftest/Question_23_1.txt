1. Which of the following is a valid way to create a PrintWriter object?
A. new PrintWriter(new Writer("file.txt"));
B. new PrintWriter();
C. new PrintWriter(new FileReader("file.txt"));
D. new PrintWriter(new OutputStream("file.txt"));

The correct answer is D.
Option A is not valid. Writer is an abstract class and cannot be instantiated.
Option B is not valid. PrintWriter has no default constructor.
Option C is not valid. PrintWriter doesn't accept a Reader as an argument in any of its constructors.
Option D is valid. PrintWriter accepts an OutputStream as a constructor argument.
