Key Points

- An I/O Stream is a sequence of data that represents the content of a file.
- An input stream is for reading and an output stream is for writing.
- In the java.io package, we can find classes to work with byte and character streams.
- There are four main abstract classes from which the rest of the classes extend from InputStream, OutputStream, Reader, Writer.
- java.io classes can be classified as:
	- Either for byte streams or character streams
	- Either for input or for output
	- Either wrappers or non-wrappers
- Java initializes and provides three stream objects as public static fields of the java.lang.System class:
	- InputStream System.in
		The standard input stream (typically the input from the keyboard)
	- PrintStream System.out
		The standard output stream (typically the default display output)
	- PrintStream System.err
		The standard error output stream (typically the default display output)
- The following table summarizes the classes reviewed in this chapter:
