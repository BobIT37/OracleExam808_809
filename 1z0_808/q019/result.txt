[Question]
Given the following class: 

And given the following main method, located in another class: 

	public class CheckingAccount {
		public int amount;
	
		public CheckingAccount(int amount) {
			this.amount = amount;
		}
	
		public int getAmount() {
			return amount;
		}
	
		public void changeAmount(int x) {
			amount += x;
		}
	}

Which three lines, when inserted independently at line n1, cause the program to print a 0 balance?

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		CheckingAccount acct = new CheckingAccount((int) (Math.random() * 1000));
		// line n1
		System.out.println(acct.getAmount());
	}
 
A. this.amount = 0; 
B. amount = 0; 
C. acct (0) ; 
D. acct.amount = 0; 
E. acct. getAmount () = 0; 
F. acct.changeAmount(0); 
G. acct.changeAmount(-acct.amount); 
H. acct.changeAmount(-acct.getAmount()); 

[Answer] D. G. H.
