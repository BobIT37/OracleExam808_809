Answer: C
---------------------------------------------------------
Explanation:

Java bytecode is already the compiled form of the Java source code, 
and the Java compiler is only available with the Java Software Development Kit (SDK). 
Once code has been compiled, it does not need to be compiled again.

All the system needs is the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 
because the JRE is able to interpret the bytecode and run it on the system.
