Which of the following data types will allow the following code snippet to compile?


float i = 4;
float j = 2;
_____ z = i + j;


A. long 
B. double 
C. int
D. float 
E. byte
Answer: B,D
Explanation:
Option B and D are the correct answer.
Since the variables I and j are floats, resultant will be float type too. 
So we have to use float or primitive type which can hold float, 
such a primitive type is double, it has wider range and also can hold floating point numbers,
hence we can use double or float for the blank. As explained above options B and D are correct.
long and int can't be used with floating point numbers so option A is incorrect.
Option E is incorrect as it have smaller range and also can't be used with floating point numbers.
