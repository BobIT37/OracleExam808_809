Question 108

Which two statements correctly describe checked exception?

	A. These are exceptional conditions that a well-written application should anticipate and
	recover from.
	B. These are exceptional conditions that are external to the application, and that the
	application usually cannot anticipate or recover from.
	C. These are exceptional conditions that are internal to the application, and that the
	application usually cannot anticipate or recover from.
	D. Every class that is a subclass of RuntimeException and Error is categorized as checked
	exception.
	E. Every class that is a subclass of Exception, excluding RuntimeException and its
	subclasses, is categorized as checked exception.




-----------------------------

Answer: A,E


For B,D is unchecked Exception

Explanation: Checked exceptions:
* (B) represent invalid conditions in areas outside the immediate control of the program
(invalid user input, database problems, network outages, absent files)
* are subclasses of Exception
It's somewhat confusing, but note as well that RuntimeException (unchecked) is itself a
subclass of Exception (checked).
* a method is obliged to establish a policy for all checked exceptions thrown by its
implementation (either pass the checked exception further up the stack, or handle it
somehow)
