Answer: B,D

Explanation: When an abstract class is subclassed, the subclass usually provides
implementations for all of the abstract methods in its parent class (C). However, if it does
not, then the subclass must also be declared abstract (B).
Note: An abstract class is a class that is declared abstract—it may or may not include
abstract methods. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated, but they can be subclassed.
