D. Compilation fails due to error at line 6. E. Compilation fails due to error at line 8.
Answer: A
Explanation:
To create we have used following method with LocalDate class;
public static LocalDate of(intyear, int month, int dayOfMonth)
Here we need to remember that month is not zero based so if you pass 1 for month, then month will be January.
Then we have used period object of 1 day and add to date object which makes current date to next day, so final output is 2015-03-27. 
Hence option A is correct.
