Give
public class  Whizlabs {
	public static void main(String[] args){
		int sum = 0;
		
		for(int x=0;x<10;x++)
			sum +=x;
		System.out.print("Sum for 0 to " + x);
		System.out.println("=" + sum);
	}
}


Which is true?
A. Sum for 0 to 0 = 55
B. Sum for 0 to 10 = 55
C. Compilation fails due to error on line 6. 
D. Compilation fails due to error on line 7. 
E. An Exception is thrown at the runtime.
Answer: D

Explanation:
Loop variables scope limited to that enclosing loop. So in this case, the scope of the loop

 variable x declared at line 5, limited to that for loop. 
 Trying to access that variable at line 7, which is out of scope of the variable x, 
 causes a compile time error. So compilation fails due to error at line 7. Hence option D is correct.
Options A and B are incorrect, since code fails to compile.
