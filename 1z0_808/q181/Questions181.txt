Question No : 181

Given:

public class SumTest {
	
	public static void doSum(Integer x, Integer y) {
		System.out.println("Integer sum is " + (x + y));
	}

	public static void doSum(double x, double y) {
		System.out.println("double sum is " + (x + y));
	}
	
	public static void doSum(float x, float y) {
		System.out.println("float sum is " + (x + y));
	}

	public static void doSum(int x, int y) {
		System.out.println("int sum is " + (x + y));
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		doSum(10, 20);
		doSum(10.0, 20.0);
	}

}

A) int sum is 30
   float sum is 30.0
B) int sum is 30
   double sum is 30 --> double sum is 30.0
C) Integer sum is 30
   double sum is 30.0
D) Integer sum is 30
   float sum is 30.0


A. Option A
B. Option B
C. Option C
D. Option D

Answer: B
Explanation:
	int sum is 30; // int can map with int, long, float, double, Integer as sort as data type priority	
	double sum is 30.0 // floating number's default data type is double (64-bit)
	// but object must be mapped with real object type only
