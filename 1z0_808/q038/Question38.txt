Which usage represents a valid way of compiling java source file with the name "Main"?
A. javac Main.java
B. java Main.class
C. java Main.java
D. javac Main
E. java Main

Answer: A


Explanation: The compiler is invoked by the javac command. When compiling a Java
class, you must include the file name, which houses the main classes including the Java
extension. So to run Main.java file we have to use command in option A.
TO execute Java program we can use Java command but can't use it for compiling.
