Question No : 195 

Given: 

public class Triangle {

	static double area;
	int b = 2, h = 3;
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		double p, b, h;		// line n1
		if (area == 0) {
			b = 3;
			h = 4;
			p = 0.5;
		}
		area = p * b * h; 	// line n2
		System.out.println("Area is " + area);
	}

}

What is the result?

A. Area is 6.0
B. Area is 3.0
C. Compilation fails at line n1
D. Compilation fails at line n2.

Answer: D

Explanation: 
The local variable p,b,h may not have been initialized 
(Beware same variable name but located in different scope)
// Fixed error at line n2 with following code at line n1
	double p=0, b=0, h=0; // initialize variable at first time
