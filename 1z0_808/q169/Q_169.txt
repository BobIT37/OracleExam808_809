int row = 10;
for(;row>0;) {
	int col = row;
	while(col >= 0) {
		System.out.println(col + " ");
		col -= 2;
	}
	row = row / col;
}
		
		
What is the result?

A. 10 8 6 4 2 0

B. 10 8 6 4 2

C. AnArithmeticException is thrown at runtime

D. The program goes into an infinite loop outputting: 10 8 6 4 2 0. . .

--------------------------
Answer : A

For Statement

for (initialization; termination; increment) {
    statement(s)
}

When using this version of the for statement, keep in mind that:

1. The initialization expression initializes the loop; it's executed once, as the loop begins.
2. When the termination expression evaluates to false, the loop terminates.
3. The increment expression is invoked after each iteration through the loop; it is perfectly acceptable for this expression to increment or decrement a value.
