Question No: 53

Given:

1.	public class Whizlabs {
2.		private String name;
3.		private boolean pass;
4.		
5.		public static void main(String[] args) {
6.			Whizlabs wb = new Whizlabs();
7.			System.out.print("name = " + wb.name);
8.			System.out.print(", pass = " + wb.pass);
9.		}
10.	}

What would be the output, if it is executed as a program?
A. name =, pass =
B. name = null, pass = null
C. name = null, pass = false
D. name = null pass = true
E. Compile error.

Answer: C
-------------

Explanation:

Both name and pass variables are instance variables, and we haven't given them any
values, so they take their default values. For Boolean default value is false and for string
which is not a primitive type default is null So at line 7, null will printed as the value of the
variable name, and at line 8 false will be printed. Hence Option C is correct.
As explained above options A, B and D are incorrect.
Code compiles fine so option E is incorrect.
