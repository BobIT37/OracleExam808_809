Given:
public class ColorTest {
public static void main(String[] args) {
	String[] colors = {"red", "blue","green","yellow","maroon","cyan"}; 
	int count = 0;
	for (String c : colors) {
		if (count >= 4) {
			break;
		}else {
			continue;
		}
		if (c.length() >= 4) {
			colors[count] = c.substring(0,3);
		}
		count++;
	}
	System.out.println(colors[count]);
	}
}
What is the result?
A. Yellow
B. Maroon
C. Compilation fails
D. A StringIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown at runtime.
Answer: C
Explanation: The line, if (c.length() >= 4) {, is never reached. This causes a compilation
 error.
Note: The continue statement skips the current iteration of a for, while , or do-while loop. 
An unlabeled break statement terminates the innermost switch, for, while, or do-while statement, 
but a labeled break terminates an outer statement.
