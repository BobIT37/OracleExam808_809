QUESTION 49
Which two code blocks correctly initialize a Locale variable?

A. Locale loc1 = "UK";
B. Locale loc2 = Locale.getInstance("ru");
C. Locale loc3 = Locale.getLocaleFactory("RU");
D. Locale loc4 = Locale.UK;
E. Locale loc5 = new Locale ("ru", "RU");

Answer: D, E

There are three main ways of creating a Locale
1. Locale.UK -> it's mean language only or both language or country
2. new Locale("ru") -> it's mean language only
3. new Locale("ru", "RU") -> it's mean both language or country
