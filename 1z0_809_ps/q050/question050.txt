QUESTION 50
Given the code fragment:

public static void main (String[] args) throws IOException {
	BufferedReader brCopy = null;
	try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader (new FileReader("employee.txt"))) { //line n1
		br.lines().forEach(c -> System.out.println(c));
		brCopy = br;//line n2
	}
	brCopy.ready(); //line n3;
}

Assume that the ready method of the BufferedReader, when called on a closed BufferedReader,
throws an exception, and employee.txt is accessible and contains valid text. What is the result?
A. A compilation error occurs at line n3.
B. A compilation error occurs at line n1.
C. A compilation error occurs at line n2.
D. The code prints the content of the employee.txt file and throws an exception at line n3.

Answer: D (duplicate 1Z0-809 Question no.93)
