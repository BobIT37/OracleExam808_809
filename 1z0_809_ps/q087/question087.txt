Given the definition of the Vehicle class:

class Vehicle {
	int distance;// line n1

	Vehicle(int x) {
		this.distance = x;
	}

	public void increSpeed(int time) {// line n2
		int timeTravel = time;// line n3

		class Car {
			int value = 0;

			public void speed() {
				value = distance / timeTravel;
				System.out.println("Velocity with new speed" + value + "kmph");
			}
		}
		new Car().speed();
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Vehicle v = new Vehicle(100);
		v.increSpeed(60);
	}
}

What is the result?

A. Velocity with new speed. <-- Velocity with new speed1kmph
B. A compilation error occurs at line n1.
C. A compilation error occurs at line n2.
