QUESTION 71

Given the code fragment:

Path path1 = Paths.get("/app/./sys/");
Path res1 = path1.resolve("log");
Path path2 = Paths.get("/server/exe/");
Path res1 = path1.resolve("/readme/");
System.out.println(res1);
System.out.println(res2);

What is the result?

A. /app/sys/log
/readme/server/exe

B. /app/log/sys
/server/exe/readme

C. /app/./sys/log
/readme

D. /app/./sys/log
/server/exe/readme

Answer: C


We can combine two paths. There are two cases.

First case. If we have an absolute path and we want to combine it with a second path that doesn't have a root element (a partial path), the second path is appended:

Path path = Paths.get("/temp");
System.out.println(path.resolve("newDir")); // /temp/newDir

Second case. If we have a partial or relative path, and we want to combine it with an absolute path, this absolute path is returned:

Path path = Paths.get("newDir");
System.out.println(path.resolve("/temp")); // /temp
