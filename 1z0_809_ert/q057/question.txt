Given that these files exist and are accessible: 

	/sports/info.txt 
	/sports/cricket/players.txt 
	/sports/cricket/data/ODI.txt 
 
and given the code fragment: 

		int maxDepth = 2;
		Stream<Path> paths = Files.find(Path.get("/sports"),
				maxDepth, 
				(p,a) -> p.getFileName().toString().endsWith("txt"),
				FileVisitOption.FOLLOW_LINKS);
		long fCount = paths.count();
		System.out.println(fCount);
 
Assuming that there are NO soft-link/symbolic links to any of the files the result? 
A) 2 
B) 3 
C) 1 
D) An Exception is thrown at runtime.
