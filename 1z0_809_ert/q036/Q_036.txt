Question: 36

Which two statements are true about the Fork/Join Framework?  

A) The Fork/Join framework can help ouo take advantage of multicore hardware. 
B) The Fork/Join solution when ren on multicore hardware always performs faster and sequential solution. 
C) The Fork/Join framework implements a work-stealing algorithm. 
D) The RecursiveTask subclass is used when a task does not need to return. 


===================
Answer: A, C
===================


Fork/Join
- Multi-Core
- Work-Stealing Algorithm
- Recursive 
	1. RecursiveTask need to return
	2. RecursiveAction no need to return.
