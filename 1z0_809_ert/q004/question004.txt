4. Which code fragment is required to load a JDBC 3.0 driver?
A) Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc : xyzdata : //localhost:3306/EmployeeDB") ;
B) Connection con = Connection.getDriver("jdbc : xyzdata : //localhotst:3306/EmployeeDB") ;
C) Class.forName("org.xyzdata.jdbc.NetworkDriver");
D) DriverManager.loadDriver("org.xyzdaga.jdbc.NetworkDriver");

Answer : C
Explanation:
In previous versions(prior to 4.0)of JDBC, to obtain a connection,
 you first had to initialize your JDBC driver by calling the method Class.forName. 
 This methods required an object of type java.sql.Driver.
Note:
DriverManager: This fully implemented class connects an application to a data source, 
which is specified by a database URL. When this class first attempts to establish a connection, 
it automatically loads any JDBC 4.0 drivers found within the class path.
