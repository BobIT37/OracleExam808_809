50. Given that data.txt and alldata.txt are accessible, and the 
	public void writeFiles() throws IOException {
		BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(getCurrentPath() + "/data.txt")); 
		BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(getCurrentPath() + "/alldata.txt")); 
		String line = null;
		while((line = br.readLine()) != null ){
			bw.append(line + "\n");
		}
		//line n1
	}

What is required at line n1 to enable the code to overwrite all 
A) bw.flush();
B) br.close();
C) br.flush();
D) bw.writeln();

----------------------------

Answer A. bw.flush();


In BufferedReader 
 - close(): Closes the stream and releases any system resources associated with it.
 
In BufferedWriter
 - close(): Closes the stream, flushing it first.
 - flush(): Flushes the stream.
