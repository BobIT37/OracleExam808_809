*** Chapter 20 Assertions
- An assertion is a statement used to check if something is true and helps you to detect errors in a program.
- If booleanExpression evaluates to FALSE, an exception of type java.lang.AssertionError (a subclass of Error) is thrown. 
and terminate.

- An assert statement has the following syntax:
	assert booleanExpression;
	assert booleanExpression: "Message about the error";
	
- Assertions are enabled in the command-line with either:
	java –ea MainClass
	Or
	java –enableassertions MainClass
	
	//Assertions can also be enabled for one class:
	java –ea:ClassName MainClass
	
	//Or for all classes in a package:
	java –ea:com.example MainClass
	
	//For enabling assertions in the unnamed package (when you don't use a package statement):
	java –ea:... MainClass
	
	
	//There's also a command to disable assertions:
	java –da MainClass
	Or
	java –disableassertions MainClass

	//With the same options that -ea. To disable for one class:
	java –da:ClassName MainClass

	//For disabling assertions in a package:
	java –da:com.example MainClass

	//For enabling assertion in the unnamed package:
	java –ea:... MainClass
	
	//To enable assertions in all the program classes except for Class1.
	java –ea -da:ClassOne MainClass
