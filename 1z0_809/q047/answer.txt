[Answer]
C.

[Explanation]
Interface BiFunction<T, U, R> has 3 generic type which R is a return type
BiFunction<Integer, Double, Integer> means anonymous method will has Integer return type
but the anonymous method is return T + U which Double has more priority then after execute will be double which is not match with Integer, the compiler will detect that mistake

[Error message]
Type mismatch: cannot convert from double to Integer
